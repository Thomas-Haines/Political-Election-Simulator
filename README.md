# Political-Election-Simulator
This program is one I created in the time in which the US Presidential Election was ongoing. As a result of this, I got rather intrigued in the different forms of voting, and decided to create a simulator, using the UK to simulate First Past The Post, the USA to simulate the Electoral College System, and Australia for the Instant Runoff system. I would've also created a fourth voting system, the Approval system in a fictional country, since it isn't actually used in the real world. For context, this fictional country is in the program, as Sodor (the home of a certain anthropomorthic tank engine), with the outputted message "This hasn't been coded yet, and as such cannot be simulated".
